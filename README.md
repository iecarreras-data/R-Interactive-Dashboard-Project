# Student Activity Dashboard (Demonstration)

This dashboard is a demonstration modeled on a real-world data product I developed during my tenure at Harvard University. The original project solved the critical challenge of synthesizing disparate data streams—such as building access swipes and event check-ins—to provide leadership with actionable intelligence on student engagement patterns.

### Data Simulation & Methodology

To protect sensitive student information, this public-facing version is built upon an entirely synthetic dataset. This process demonstrates a key modern skill:

-   **Generative AI for Data Simulation:** Leveraged GenAI techniques to create a realistic, high-fidelity dataset that mimics the structure and complexity of real-world student activity. This allows for full-featured development and demonstration while ensuring complete privacy and ethical data handling.

### Core Competencies Showcased

This project highlights my end-to-end ability to transform a business need into a deployed data solution:

*   **Conceptualize and Build a Data Product:** Taking a strategic goal from an initial idea to a functional, interactive tool.
*   **Synthesize and Integrate Data:** Merging different data sources to create a unified and comprehensive view of user behavior.
*   **Develop Dynamic Visualizations:** Building user-friendly interfaces in R (`Plotly`, `crosstalk`) that empower non-technical stakeholders to explore complex data independently.

The result is a powerful tool that transforms raw, disconnected data into an intuitive platform for strategic decision-making.
